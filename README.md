# Beautician/Spa website 

## This is my first school project and also my first coding project ever. 
The project assignment was to create an 2-4 webpages with using only HTML and CSS but I also used Bootsrap because I wanted to make my site responsive, and here is my final project! https://sheerzad9.github.io/index.html <br /><br />
This project was done all by myself and the idea behind it was to create an demo site for an beautician/spa like website.
