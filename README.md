# Beautician/Spa website 

## This is my first school project and also my first coding project ever. 
The project assignment was to create an 2-4 webpages with using only HTML and CSS but I also used Bootsrap because I wanted to make my site responsive, and here is my final project! https://sheerzad9.github.io/index.html
This project was done all by myself and the idea behind it was to create and demo site for an beautician/spa like website. There is broken picture in the "Meist√§" site, https://sheerzad9.github.io/third.html
I want to fixt it but at the same time I don't want to touch it because I like to keep it as It was after submitting the assignment for the first time.
